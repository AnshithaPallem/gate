## Data Structure
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.

**1.Linear Data Structure:** Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 

**Example:** Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.

**2.Static Data Structure:** Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 

**Example:** array.

**3.Dynamic Data Structure:** In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 

**Example:** Queue, Stack, linked list.

**4.Non-Linear Data Structure:** Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 

**Examples:** Trees and Graphs.

## Array
Array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. Elements are allocated contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access. Each element has a unique index number.

### Declaration of Array
arr = []

### Initialization of Array
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

arr = [1.4, 2.0, 24.0, 5.0, 0.0]  # All float values
